This is a JavaFX timer that I made for my son. Select an online program on the right and push the start button. The timer will count
down from the time required and will release the END button when time is completed. The start and end times aren't recorded until the 
END button is pressed in the event he has to finish a module, it will collect all of his time on the site.

The start and end time, date, and total minutes are recorded to a SQLite database.

Associated reports will be coming soon.
